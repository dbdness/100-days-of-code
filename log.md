# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 22, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Started working on incorporating Firebase DB in my DDL app. 

**Thoughts:** Slow process at first. The DDL project is over 8 months old, so I had to upgrade a lot of configs in the Grade and build files, but now it works fine. I chose to try and go with FirebaseDB which is a NoSQL JSON-based database from Google. It looks easy to integrate and use. The data can be saved in the cloud as well.
